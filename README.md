# gareddit-server

Welcome to Gareddit, a message board application I am building using modern technologies such as React, Next.JS, Typescript, Express, and PostgreSQL on the back-end. This project is the server-side portion of the project, which together with the client code, offers many features to the end-users of the program, including registration, authentication, posting, a like system and more! New features are constantly being added, so be sure to check back again in the future.
